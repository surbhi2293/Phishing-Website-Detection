# Phishing-Website-Detection
To detect whether a website is phishing is phishing or not using various machine learning classifiers

The dataset used is the UCI Phishing Websites Dataset

To run the R code, simply run the script provided in the file named Phishing.R in RStudio or your R environment. Do this after you have loaded the dataset. 

Attach all the required packages. You'll obtain accuracies and MSE for various techniques. Based on my analysis, Random Forest gives the best results as it outperfoms both in terms of Accuracy and MSE. Neural nets tends to overfit.
